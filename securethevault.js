/*Create a variable that holds a string that says "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault.  Here is the secret combination."
the combination is 10, 40, 39.
Create a variable that gives an answer back of 10.  const num1 = 5 + 5
Create a variable that gives an answer back of 40.  const num2 = 20 * 2
Create a variable that gives and answer back of 39  const num3 = 239 % 100
Create an alert that will print out the string and all three combination numbers in order along with spaces in between.

//I named my variable message since it is a message and then gave it the value of exactly what my message should read.
const message = "You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:";
//I used const over let to create my arithmetic variables because a combination on a vault isn't going to change during this process
const num1 = 5 + 5;
//5 plus 5 = 10
const num2 = 20 * 2;
//20 times 2 = 40
const num3 = 239 % 100;
//239 divided by 100 leaves a remainder of 39
//created an alert that would pop up and show the message that is in a string, along with the 3 combination answers
alert(hey + " " + num1 + " " + num2 + " " + num3);
//When putting this into the console it worked!
